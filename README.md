Visit https://vax4nyc.nyc.gov/patient/s/vaccination-schedule
When you reach the Schedule an appointment page -  https://www.evernote.com/l/APZVAa5XTSVA8bJn997mcw8jN6H9JS-s_2E

Right click -> inspect -> Console 

in the console, type - 
var event = new CustomEvent("BillGates5g", {detail: "chimbs rocks"});
window.dispatchEvent(event);

And it will keep trying to find a spot for you. 

This should find an appointment for you in about 5-10 mins. It will find the first available appointment that it finds. You cannot control where/when/which shot it will be. You will only have access to the signup page after the pappointment is complete.
